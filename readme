Elise Kratzer Ernest McCarter Assignment Number 3

We like to do pair programming to learn the most.
Elise took the lead on taking the first pass at getting the secondary page 
to conform to the correct behavior during the whole process and at the end. 
She reviewed lecture slides to get familiar with the html code. She tested 
the code against the reference solution and reviewed Ernest's error handling 
work. Elise built on runserver.py.

Ernest began with the primary page layout and started runserver.py. He fixed 
the wildcard issues which we had in both the first two assignments and did 
not notice in our grade reports until now. He wrote the error handling error 
messages, such as the non-integer classid error. He ran different tests on our 
code to compare it to the reference solution at the end.

We received no help from other people except viewing Ed posts.

Sources of info we used include lecture slides and Ed postings.

The assignment took 8 hours.

It helped us get very familiar with html and cookies. We had not used cookies 
before, but we had minimal experience with html. We also continue to get more 
diligent at error handling. We enjoyed the assignment because it's fun to see 
our results live as we make edits and additions. It is useful to have the 
skills to create what we did.
